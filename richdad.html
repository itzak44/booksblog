<h2>RICH DAD POOR DAD</h2>
<h4>Catergory:: FINANCE , EDUCATION </h4>
<h5>Writer: <span> Robert T. Kiyosaki</span></h5>
<p>The story begins with the author as a young boy, observing the contrasting 
    financial mindsets and behaviors of his two dads. His poor dad, who held a high position 
    in education, emphasized the importance of academic success, job security, and living within 
    one's means. On the other hand, his rich dad, a successful entrepreneur, believed in building 
    assets, investing wisely, and acquiring financial knowledge.Throughout the book, Kiyosaki shares
     anecdotes and conversations that he had with his rich dad, who guided him on various aspects of 
     money, wealth creation, and financial independence. He learns valuable lessons about the difference
      between assets and liabilities, the power of financial education, and the importance of taking 
      calculated risks. Kiyosaki emphasizes the significance of acquiring assets that generate income, 
      such as real estate and businesses, as opposed to liabilities that drain money, such as excessive 
      consumer debt and unnecessary expenses. He introduces concepts like the cash flow quadrant, which 
      categorizes individuals as employees, self-employed, business owners, or investors, highlighting
       the advantages and disadvantages of each quadrant.The book also delves into the mindset and
       beliefs around money, discussing the importance of developing a positive relationship with 
       wealth and overcoming limiting beliefs. Kiyosaki stresses the need for financial literacy 
       and encourages readers to take control of their financial destinies by seeking out opportunities, 
       learning from mistakes, and continuously educating themselves about money and its power. <span><a href="https://www.kobo.com/in/en/ebook/rich-dad-poor-dad-9">  Read book pdf</span></a></p>
