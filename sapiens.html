<h2>SAPIENS</h2>
<h4>Catergory:: SCIENCE , NON-FICITON </h4>
<h5>Writer: <span> Yuval Noah Harari</span></h5>
<p>From a renowned historian comes a groundbreaking narrative of humanity’s creation
     and evolution—a #1 international bestseller—that explores the ways in which biology
      and history have defined us and enhanced our understanding of what it means to be “human.” 
      One hundred thousand years ago, at least six different species of humans inhabited Earth.
       Yet today there is only one—homo sapiens. What happened to the others? And what may happen
        to us? Most books about the history of humanity pursue either a historical or a biological 
        approach, but Dr. Yuval Noah Harari breaks the mold with this highly original book that begins 
        about 70,000 years ago with the appearance of modern cognition. From examining the role evolving
         humans have played in the global ecosystem to charting the rise of empires, Sapiens integrates 
         history and science to reconsider accepted narratives, connect past developments with 
         contemporary concerns, and examine specific events within the context of larger ideas. 
         Dr. Harari also compels us to look ahead, because over the last few decades humans have 
         begun to bend laws of natural selection that have governed life for the past four billion
          years. We are acquiring the ability to design not only the world around us, but also 
          ourselves. Where is this leading us, and what do we want to become? Featuring 27 photographs,
           6 maps, and 25 illustrations/diagrams, this provocative and insightful work is sure to
            spark debate and is essential reading for aficionados of Jared Diamond, James Gleick, 
            Matt Ridley, Robert Wright, and Sharon Moalem. <span><a href="https://www.kobo.com/in/en/ebook/sapiens-5">  Read book pdf</span></a></p>
