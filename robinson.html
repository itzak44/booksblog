<h2>ROBINSON CRUSOE</h2>
<h4>Catergory:: ACTION , SURVIVAL , FICITON </h4>
<h5>Writer: <span> Daniel Defoe</span></h5>
<p>Robinson Crusoe (the family name corrupted from the German name "Kreutznaer") sets sail from Kingston
     upon Hull on a sea voyage in August 1651, against the wishes of his parents, who wanted him to 
     pursue a career in law. After a tumultuous journey where his ship is wrecked in a storm, his desire
      for the sea remains so strong that he sets out to sea again. This journey, too, ends in disaster, 
      as the ship is taken over by Salé pirates (the Salé Rovers) and Crusoe is enslaved by a Moor. Two 
      years later, he escapes in a boat with a boy named Xury; a captain of a Portuguese ship off the
       west coast of Africa rescues him. The ship is en route to Brazil. Crusoe sells Xury to the 
       captain. With the captain's help, Crusoe procures a plantation in Brazil.Years later, Crusoe 
       joins an expedition to purchase slaves from Africa but is shipwrecked in a storm about forty
        miles out to sea on an island off the Venezuelan coast (which he calls the Island of Despair)
         near the mouth of the Orinoco River on 30 September 1659. He observes the latitude as 9
          degrees and 22 minutes north. He sees penguins and seals on this island. Only he, the 
          captain's dog, and two cats survive the shipwreck. Overcoming his despair, he fetches arms
          , tools and other supplies from the ship before it breaks apart and sinks. He builds a fenced
          -in habitat near a cave which he excavates. By making marks in a wooden cross, he creates a 
          calendar. By using tools salvaged from the ship, and some which he makes himself, he hunts,
           grows barley and rice, dries grapes to make raisins, learns to make pottery and raises goats.
            He also adopts a small parrot. He reads the Bible and becomes religious, thanking God for his fate in which nothing is missing but human society.
    More years pass and Crusoe discovers cannibals, who occasionally visit the island to kill and eat 
    prisoners. He plans to kill them for committing an abomination, but later realizes he has no right 
    to do so, as the cannibals do not knowingly commit a crime. He dreams of obtaining one or two 
    servants by freeing some prisoners; when a prisoner escapes, Crusoe helps him, naming his new 
    companion "Friday" after the day of the week he appeared. Crusoe teaches Friday the English
     language and converts him to Christianity.After more cannibals arrive to partake in a feast, 
     Crusoe and Friday kill most of them and save two prisoners. One is Friday's father and the other
      is a Spaniard, who informs Crusoe about other Spaniards shipwrecked on the mainland. A plan is 
      devised wherein the Spaniard would return to the mainland with Friday's father and bring back the 
      others, build a ship, and sail to a Spanish port. Before the Spaniards return, an English 
      ship appears; mutineers have commandeered the vessel and intend to maroon their captain 
      on the island. Crusoe and the ship's captain strike a deal in which Crusoe helps the captain 
      and the loyal sailors retake the ship. With their ringleader executed by the captain,
       the mutineers take up Crusoe's offer to be marooned on the island rather than being returned 
       to England as prisoners to be hanged. Before embarking for England, Crusoe shows the mutineers
        how he survived on the island and states that there will be more men coming.<span><a href="https://www.kobo.com/in/en/ebook/robinson-crusoe-225">  Read book pdf</span></a></p>
