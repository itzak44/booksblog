<h2>THAT NIGHT</h2>
<h4>Catergory:: HORROR , FICTION </h4>
<h5>Writer: <span> Nidhi Upadhyay</span></h5>
<p>Natasha, Riya, Anjali and Katherine were best friends in college—each different from the other yet
     inseparable—until that night.It was the night that began with a bottle of whisky and a game of 
     Ouija but ended with the death of Sania, their unlikeable hostel mate. The friends had vowed never
      to discuss that fateful night, a pact that kept their friendship and guilt dormant for the last
       twenty years.But now, someone has begun to mess with them, threatening to reveal the truth that 
       only Sania knew. Is it a hacker playing on their guilt, or has Sania's ghost really returned to 
       venge her death? As the faceless enemy closes in on them, the friends come together once again
        to recount what really happened that night. But when the story is retold by each of them, the 
        pieces don’t match. Because none of them is telling the whole truth . That Night is a dark,
         twisted tale of friendship and betrayal that draws you in and confounds you at every turn. <span><a href="https://www.kobo.com/in/en/ebook/that-night-33">  Read book pdf</span></a></p>
