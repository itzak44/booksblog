<h2>FIVE CAME BACK</h2>
<h4>Catergory:: WAR , ACTION , NON-FICTION</h4>
<h5>Writer: <span> Mark Harris</span></h5>
<p>In Pictures at a Revolution, Mark Harris turned the story of the five movies
     nominated for Best Picture in 1967 into a landmark work of cultural history,
      a book about the transformation of an art form and the larger social shift
       it signified. In Five Came Back, he achieves something larger and even more 
       remarkable, giving us the untold story of how Hollywood changed World War II,
        and how World War II changed Hollywood, through the prism of five film directors
         caught up in the war: John Ford, William Wyler, John Huston, Frank Capra, and George
          Stevens. It was the best of times and the worst of times for Hollywood before the war. 
          The box office was booming, and the studios’ control of talent and distribution was as 
          airtight as could be hoped. But the industry’s relationship with Washington was decidedly 
          uneasy—hearings and investigations into allegations of corruption and racketeering were
           multiplying, and hanging in the air was the insinuation that the business was too foreign, 
           too Jewish, too un-American” in its values and causes. Could an industry this powerful in 
           shaping America’s mind-set really be left in the hands of this crew? Following Pearl Harbor,
            Hollywood had the chance to prove its critics wrong and did so with vigor, turning its 
            talents and its business over to the war effort to an unprecedented extent. No industry 
            professionals played a bigger role in the war than America’s most legendary directors: 
            Ford, Wyler, Huston, Capra, and Stevens. Between them they were on the scene of almost 
            every major moment of America’s war, and in every branch of service—army, navy, and air
             force; Atlantic and Pacific; from Midway to North Africa; from Normandy to the fall of 
             Paris and the liberation of the Nazi death camps; to the shaping of the message out of 
             Washington, D.C. As it did for so many others, World War II divided the lives of these 
             men into before and after, to an extent that has not been adequately understood. In a 
             larger sense—even less well understood—the war divided the history of Hollywood into 
             before and after as well. Harris reckons with that transformation on a human level—through
              five unforgettable lives—and on the level of the industry and the country as a whole.
               Like these five men, Hollywood too, and indeed all of America, came back from the war
                having grown up more than a little. <span><a href="https://www.kobo.com/in/en/ebook/five-came-back-1">  Read book pdf</span></a></p>
